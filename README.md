# DeepGR4J for Extreme flows

This repository extends the work from [DeepGR4J](https://github.com/DARE-ML/DeepGR4J) to improve predictions on extreme events. The initial experiments use quantile regression to achieve this. 


### Notebook Overview
 - `quantile_reg_nn.ipynb`: Implements quantile regression for a basic MLP
 - `qdeepgr4j_cnn.ipynb`: Extends this quantile regression workflow to DeepGR4J-CNN model
 - `qdeepgr4j_lstm.ipynb`: Extends this quantile regression workflow to DeepGR4J-LSTM model
